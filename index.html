<h3>The New Consultic.us</h3>
<p>The site is now written locally in iA Writer, outputting markdown, cranked out to a static site with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and synchronized with Git hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/" title="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<p>Badda-boom, Badda-bing!</p>

<h2>What This Means</h2>
<p>I'm current. I'm cool. I'm not (as) slow as I was when using PHP-based CMS workflows. I no longer need a database to run for a handful of static pages; the equivalent of a gas-guzzling SUV to drive to the mailbox.</p>

<h2>What This Doesn't Mean</h2>
<p>The new creation and deployment workflow doesn't change the need for proper design. I still like to start in Photoshop (sometimes Illustrator) to create a visual language.</p>

<h3>To Do</h3>
<ul><li>Get up to speed on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/0" title="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/0">Jekyll</a>
</li></ul>
