# State of Web Work
*This is the way I view Web work from the trench.*

# My Heros
[Hillmancurtis.com](http://hillmancurtis.com) Was my earliest mentor by proxy. He was a great person all-around. Designer, motion designer and film director. Learn about him.

[Todd Pergason](http://toddp.me/) Is the second master I've followed since my early days in design. He founded and built [JUXT Interactive](http://www.juxtinteractive.com). There's no shortage of what you can learn there.
