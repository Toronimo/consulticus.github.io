# State of Web Work
*This is the way I view Web work from the trench.*

# My Heros
[Hillmancurtis.com](http://hillmancurtis.com) Was my earliest mentor by proxy. He was a great person all-around. Designer, motion designer and film director. Learn about him.

[Todd Pergason](http://toddp.me/) Is the second master I've followed since my early days in design. He founded and built [JUXT Interactive](http://www.juxtinteractive.com). There's no shortage of what you can learn there.

# The Most Important Things
Take this for what it's worth. For me, it's worth remembering. I believe that being organized and speaking well, that is being able to clearly articulate what it is you do, why you do it, or what needs to be done and why, are skills that you should dig for more than anything else in your professional endeavors. If you're a master at whatever, but you're a horrible person to be around...you get the idea. It just makes sense.

### Organization
Fall out of love with the two extremes of what's touted as *good* or *normal* for designers. I believe that if someone trusts me to provide something for them, beit visual or code, it's on me to get it done. And getting things done means not forgetting, not dropping the ball and being reliable. Whatever that looks like for you, do it. I don't believe in lowering my standard to the stereotypical slobbery and absent-mindedness of the creative lifestyle. Nor do I assign a shit's-worth of value to the deification of OCD touted by many accomplished folk in technology today. Be yourself. Be reliable. Be friendly and humble.
