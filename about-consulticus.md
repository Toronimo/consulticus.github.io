## Consulticus Exists to Equip You

There are technicians in abundance. There are strategists and *idea guys* galore. But the question of what's necessary goes largely unanswered or worse, unasked. The proof is in the excorcism necessary to perform even basic layouts accross most browsers and devices. Not to speak of design and development workflow. Each agency and freelancer has their own *special blend*, a magic dance coupled with a dash of ego to cure an ailing business.

The web and its workers are hardly more than coal miners with very little light. Each dirty digger claims credit for some capability that relates to the foundation of all that is web and interactive. You'd be hard-pressed to find a single one to take the fall for the infuriating beaurocracy of getting software done properly.

This is a place of mediocrity. Consulticus exists to bring a business perspective to a place of superiority and conquest.

Business has settled for what the limitations imposed by *intelligent* individuals or entities.

I'm not satisfied with the Web. It's just now become hardly better than it was fifteen years ago. Why? Why the hell does it take so long for things like standardized ways of creating, deploying, maintaining and updating web sites? 

Greed and impatience.

Or at least greed and selfishness.

For all the *openness* touted in the Web community, there are hardly a handful of us who actually give a shit about the Web more than we do about getting ours. It's the same as the old-schoolers.

So, here's Consulticus. It's my business. It's my way of approaching problem-solving for enterprise web apps and sites.

Consulticus exists to equip your business.

What does that look like? There is no single answer. It depends on what your business needs to do. For example, you may need to break free from the crust common to your industry where, if anyone does use Twitter or Facebook, it's done with a starchy approach attempting transparency and authenticity but looking more like veneer and faux-finish.
